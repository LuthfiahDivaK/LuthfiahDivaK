# Hi there 🧚‍♀️
## I'm Diva 🦋
### I am a Geophysics Undergraduate Student at Gadjah Mada University. a dedicated person with passion for embracing challenges and exploring new experiences. I believe that stepping out of my comfort zone is essential for personal growth and development, and I’m committed to continuously evolving into the best version of myself.
### Outside of my academic pursuits, I am deeply interested in reading a wide range of materials, including fiction, non-fiction, and articles. This not only serves as a source of relaxation but also plays a crucial role in sharpening my critical thinking skills and fostering creativity.
